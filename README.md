# Backend Final Project
An attempt at creating a full-stack application. 

## ***TOPIC***
This project will be a platform for filmmakers on an amateur and semi-profi level. It aims at
conecting talents over commonly shared ideas and how to realise them in an joined effort.

The focus will specifically be on allowing users to register/create a profile with fairly 
known schema attributes (e.g. username, password, profession, email) and the possibility to
browse a blackboard for exisiting collaboration opportunities. And of course you will be 
able to upload your own pitches via a form section.

Most consideration has revolved around the backend structure at this moment. It's clearly about
laying the groundwork for an application like this. So the handling of schema models, database
and routes will come first before we settle for the design of the frontent.
