# Backend Final Project
An attempt at creating a full-stack application. 

## ***TOPIC***
We will create a platform for filmmakers on an amateur and semi-profi level. 
It aims at connecting talents over commonly shared ideas for joined effort.

We will focus on:
    – allowing users to register/creating profiles with fairly known
      schema attributes(e.g. username, password, profession, email)
    – browsing a blackboard for existing collaboration opportunities
    – enable them to upload own pitches via a form section

Most thoughts will be put into the backend structure. So a groundwork will be layed
with the handling of schema models, database and routes.
